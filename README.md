# About

These projects are created when writing Directus guest articles.

## Create a new project

From the project root run:
```bash
./create.sh <project-name> 
```

This will install Nuxt with the Directus SDK and create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root.

You can now run Directus with `docker-compose up` and run the front end with `npm run dev`.
